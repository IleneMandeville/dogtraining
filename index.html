<h2 class="head">General Information</h2>
<p class="info">There are four main types of dog training. The first <br>two are known as behavioral dog training and <br>obedience dog training. These types of training are <br>generaly used when the dog is still in his or her <br>puppy years. Another training styles is the agility <br>dog training style. This type is generaly taught to <br>dogs who have already been taught the first two types <br>and will participate in dog shows. The final type of <br>dog training is the vocational style of dog training. <br>This type of training is for the dogs who will become <br>apart of the military or will become a service dog. <br>Dogs that become apart of the military have certain <br>jobs based on the breed and skills they have. Some <br>examples of the different types of service dogs are <br>guide dogs, hearing dogs, mobility assistance dogs, <br>diabetic alert dogs, seizure alert dogs, seizure <br>response dogs, psychiatric service dogs, autism <br>support dogs, FASD service dogs, and allergy detection <br>dogs.</p>

<h2 class="head">The origin of Dog Training</h2>
    <p class="info">Before World War 1, formal dog training was <br>not needed since dogs were not thought of <br>as members of the family. At the time all <br>dogs did were the jobs the family needed <br>them to do like hunting, providing protection, <br>and herding. In exchange, the family provided <br>the dog with a home and the dog's basic <br>needs. With dogs having to do the same tasks <br>every day, they ended up in a sense, "training" <br>themselves. Unfortunatly there were some dogs <br>that could not keep up with their intense <br>training and were referred to as inferior. The dogs who could succeed, were thought of as the alphas and were the ones most capable of learning. After the war, it was viewed as okay by society for the trainors to train dogs cruely from then on. Obedience training was introduced by the American Kennel Club in the late 1930's. When World War 2 began dogs and the cruel training method were needed again to meet the demand of dogs needed. At the time, owners were spending more time away from home and needed the cruel training method since the dogs were behaving badly. After the Korean War and the Police Action of Vietnam, the punishment training for an award became more popular. In the 1970's the obedience dog training style became more available and harsher methods were used less. Although the harsher methods are bad by today's standards, the trainers were not trying to abuse the dogs. The term "dominance" was added in the 1980's after some reseach done on some wolves. As time went on more training methods were created like the Koehler Method, the Clicker Method, the "Purely Positive" Method, and the Reward Method.</p>
