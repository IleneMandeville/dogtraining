<h2 class="head">General Information</h2>
<p class="info"> The first thought that comes to mind when <br>Agility Dog Training is mentioned is a <br>dog show. This training style is infact <br>very beneficial to the dog and trainor <br>alike. This training style gives both he <br>owner and their dog some daily exersises <br>and new commands to use. The sport of dog <br>agility is only a few decades old. It was <br>first created to fill the gap of time <br>between dog shows. This dog training style <br>can closen the bond bettween an owner and <br>their dog and can be a lot of fun.</p>
